## üèóÔ∏è System Design (Architecture Overview)

```
Client -> API Gateway -> [ Auth Service | Product Service | Order Service | ... ]
                             |
                      Discovery Server (Eureka)
                             |
                     Central Config Server
```

- Communication: REST APIs and asynchronous messaging (Kafka/RabbitMQ)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Java 17+
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
- **Databases:** MySQL / PostgreSQL (per service)
- **Messaging:** RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka
- **Authentication:** Spring Security, JWT
- **Config Management:** Spring Cloud Config
- **Service Discovery:** Netflix Eureka
- **API Gateway:** Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Build Tool:** Maven or Gradle
- **Monitoring:** Spring Boot Actuator, Prometheus, Grafana

---

## üìê Non-Functional Requirements
